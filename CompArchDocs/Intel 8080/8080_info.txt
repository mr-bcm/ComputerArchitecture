8080:

    used signals:
       d0:7 -- data bus (3-state) <->
       a0:15 -- address bus (3-state)
       timing/control outouts: sync, dbin, wait, wr, hlda, and inte
             inputs: ready, hold, int, and reset
       power inputs: +12v, +5v, -5v, gnd
       2 clock inputs: ph1 and ph2

    Architecture:
       register array and address logic
       alu
       instruct register and ctrl section
       <-> 3-state data bus buffer

    Registers:
       pc, sp, (b,c; d,e; h,l are 8-bit gen purpose regs)
        w,z -- temp reg

    ALU:
       registers:
           8-bit accumulator (act)
           5-bit flag register: zero, carry, sign, parity, and aux carry
           8-bit temp reg (tmp)


    Instruction set:
       instructions are 8-bit long, it may be multiple bytes
          first byte is opcode, succeeding bytes are either data or address
             data or address could be written across multiple bytes
